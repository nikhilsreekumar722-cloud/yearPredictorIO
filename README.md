# 🔮 yearPredictorIO

A revolutionary project that asks the brave question:  
**"What comes after this year?"**

## 🧠 How It Works
- You enter the current year (e.g., 2025)
- It reveals the next year (e.g., 2026)
- That’s literally it.

## 😎 Why This Exists
Because not all heroes build useful apps.  
Some just waste your time with style.
